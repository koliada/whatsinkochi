# What's in Kochi?

Figures out what's for lunch in [Kochi Aidad](http://www.kochiaidad.ee/) for today.

# Prerequisites

Currently, only Mac supported :(

Will install [pup](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup) via Homebrew on first run.

# Usage

Just

    ./whatsinkochi.sh

...or add an alias to your `.bash_profile` or other corresponding shell config.
